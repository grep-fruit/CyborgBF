### This is just the code from my website where I show my art stuff. 

For now I've kept it pretty simple. It's just HTML and CSS.

Eventually I'll add more features, but not many.

I'm putting this here so that you can look at it, if you want.

### List of stuff I'm going to do next
(keeping this just so that I feel accountable and actually get around to it)

Add a Gallery tab with a gallery of different stuff I made
Change "Art" tab name to "shop"
Fix the "clicktoenlarge" so that it is centered properly
Add clicktrough slides for stickers/prints/zines

### Licencing stuff

ART : Images of art, pictures and poetry (content in general) is mine. You can put it somewhere, but you have to let me know and credit me by linking to this website. 

CODE : Code is Free (as in freedom) and you may reuse bits of it, if you ever wanted to. If I borrow stuff, I specify where it's from in the comments or in the content (dependingly). If you're borrowing stuff I borrowed, credit the original person. If you're borrowing stuff I did, it would be nice to link to my site.

I know this is not a proper licence, but it will do for now.
