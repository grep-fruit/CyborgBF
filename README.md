# This is just the code from my website where I show my art stuff. 
For now I've kept it pretty simple.

Todo : 
technical:
uniformize css classes
create slideshows and make images enlargeable
solve key stuff

content:
add info about how i do my art, and stuff on the about page
add link to this page (after things are corrected)

structural:
add a gallery page with hand drawn art

fun/aesthetic : 
add cool light effects
